Implement the push and pall opcodes.

The push opcode

The opcode push pushes an element to the stack.

Usage: push <int>
where <int> is an integer
if <int> is not an integer or if there is no argument given to push, print the error message L<line_number>: usage: push integer, followed by a new line, and exit with the status EXIT_FAILURE
where is the line number in the file
You won’t have to deal with overflows. Use the atoi function
The pall opcode

The opcode pall prints all the values on the stack, starting from the top of the stack.

Usage pall
Format: see example
If the stack is empty, don’t print anything
